# moz-devtools-gitbot
A bot which listens to Github Webhooks and does nice things.


## How to set up (WIP)

 - Fork or clone repository.
 - Inside the repo, set up mozilla-central folder with mercurial and debugger.html folder with GitHub.
 - Make sure your credentials are set up for GitHub i.e. you don't have to entire password for pushes (it will fail then).
 - Make appropriate changes in constants.js (as needed).
 - Rest is npm install and npm run start.
 - You can view logs in the console or in the web console.
